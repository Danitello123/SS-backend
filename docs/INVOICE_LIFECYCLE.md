# Invoice Lifecycle

Invoice status changes go through a single state machine,
[`src/lib/invoice-state-machine.ts`](../src/lib/invoice-state-machine.ts). It
enforces the graph, the role allowed to take each step, and each step's
precondition. It also records every change in `invoice_status_history` and runs
side effects exactly once after the change commits.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> draft
  draft --> pending: seller submits for review
  draft --> published: seller publishes directly
  draft --> rejected: admin rejects
  draft --> cancelled: seller / admin discards
  pending --> published: admin approves
  pending --> rejected: admin rejects
  pending --> cancelled: seller withdraws / admin
  published --> funded: fully subscribed (system)
  published --> cancelled: admin closeout
  funded --> settled: settlement completes
  funded --> cancelled: admin void
  settled --> [*]
  rejected --> [*]
  cancelled --> [*]
```

In the terms used by issue #468: `draft` = submitted, `pending` = under review,
`published` = active.

## Transitions

| From → To                        | Allowed roles         | Precondition                         | Error when it fails                  |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `draft → pending`                | seller (owner)        | `validateInvoiceForPublish()` passes | 422 `invoice_not_publishable`        |
| `draft → published`              | seller (owner)        | `validateInvoiceForPublish()` passes | 422 `invoice_not_publishable`        |
| `pending → published`            | admin                 | `validateInvoiceForPublish()` passes | 422 `invoice_not_publishable`        |
| `draft / pending → rejected`     | admin                 | non-empty reason                     | 422 `transition_precondition_failed` |
| `published → funded`             | system                | committed amount ≥ net amount        | 422 `transition_precondition_failed` |
| `funded → settled`               | admin, system         | —                                    | —                                    |
| `draft / pending → cancelled`    | seller (owner), admin | —                                    | —                                    |
| `published / funded → cancelled` | admin                 | —                                    | —                                    |

A transition that is not in the table is rejected with **422
`invalid_status_transition`**. A role that the table does not allow, or a seller
who does not own the invoice, is rejected with **403 `transition_not_permitted`**.
Invoice routes return these errors in a structured form:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION",
    "message": "Cannot transition invoice from funded to published. Allowed next statuses from funded: settled, cancelled.",
    "details": {
      "from": "funded",
      "to": "published",
      "allowedTransitions": ["settled", "cancelled"]
    }
  }
}
```

## History

Each transition writes a row to `invoice_status_history` in the same
database transaction as the status update: `from_status`, `to_status`,
`actor_role`, `actor_id`, `trigger` (e.g. `fully_funded`), `reason` and
`created_at`. The current status stays on `invoices.status`.
`GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/history` returns an invoice's history to its seller.

## Side effects

`InvoiceStateMachine.transition()` only validates and persists. Callers run
`dispatch()` after their transaction commits, so a rolled-back change never
notifies anyone. Dispatching the same transition twice is a no-op. The built-in
effects are:

- the `Invoice lifecycle state transition.` audit log
- a seller notification (when a notification service is configured)
- cache invalidation of `invoice:<id>`, `seller:<sellerId>:invoices` and
  `marketplace:listings` (when a `CacheInvalidator` is configured)

A failing effect is logged and does not block the others or fail the request.

## Notifications

In-app notifications are stored in the `notifications` table with a `read`
flag:

| Event                                                  | Recipients             | Type                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| New investment                                         | investor, seller       | `investment_created` |
| Invoice funded                                         | seller, every investor | `invoice_funded`     |
| Invoice settled                                        | seller, every investor | `invoice_settled`    |
| Invoice rejected                                       | seller                 | `invoice_rejected`   |
| Other status changes (submitted, published, cancelled) | seller                 | `invoice`            |

"Every investor" means each user with a pending, confirmed or settled
investment in the invoice, notified once even if they hold several positions.
New-investment notifications are sent after the investment commits. A
notification that fails to store is logged and never fails the investment.

Authenticated users read their notifications through:

- `GET /api/v1/notifications`: paginated, filterable by `read` and `type`
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/unread-count`: `{ "unread": n }`
- `PATCH /api/v1/notifications/:id/read`
- `PATCH /api/v1/notifications/read-all`: one `UPDATE`, returns `{ "updated": n }`

## Endpoints

| Endpoint                                  | Transition                                                |

| `POST /api/v1/invoices/:id/invest`        | published → funded, when the investment fills the invoice |
| `POST /api/v1/investments`                | published → funded, when the investment completes funding |
| `POST /api/v1/settlements/:invoiceId`     | funded → settled                                          |
